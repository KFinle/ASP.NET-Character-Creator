# ASP.NET-Character-Creator
Created for Net Development II - Lab 5 
<hr/>

For Lab 5 I decided to make a CRUD web app where a user can create sample characters, skills, and jobs for an RPG game. 
I chose to do this because it was directly in line with a separate personal project I am working on, so I already had RPGs on the brain. 
In that project however, it’s a turn-based combat simulation for command line written in C++ where the characters and enemies are currently static entities.
They have all the stats you’d expect, but I have not built in any level up system, meaning I have no way to gain experience or calculate stat increases or 
gain new skills.

With this assignment, I thought it would be interesting to create a web app that not only allows me to create new characters, jobs, and skills, but also 
would allow me to automatically calculate stat gains when making edits to the characters. 

I would like to continue working on this project. I will likely create a private development repository as I workshop features. 
Not only is it useful for growing as a developer, but it also has the potential to be a tool I will actually use again in the future. 
I believe that by the time I’m done, I will have a genuinely interesting portfolio piece that I can talk about excitedly in the future.
