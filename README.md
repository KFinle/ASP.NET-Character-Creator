# ASP.NET-Character-Creator
Created for Net Development II - Lab 5 
<hr/>

For Lab 5 I decided to make a CRUD web app where a user can create sample characters, skills, and jobs for an RPG game. 
I chose to do this because it was directly in line with a separate personal project I am working on, so I already had RPGs on the brain. 
In that project however, it’s a turn-based combat simulation for command line written in C++ where the characters and enemies are currently static entities.
They have all the stats you’d expect, but I have not built in any level up system, meaning I have no way to gain experience or calculate stat increases or 
gain new skills.

With this assignment, I thought it would be interesting to create a web app that not only allows me to create new characters, jobs, and skills, but also 
would allow me to automatically calculate stat gains when making edits to the characters. 

Admittedly, I am not nearly done making this application. I believe it is sufficient for the purpose of the assignment,but now that I have spent so long
on it, I am fully committed to making it into a fully functioning character generator I can use when prototyping RPG combat systems. When reviewing the code, 
you’ll notice a couple unused data fields on the Character model. I ran out of time before implementing the next feature – dynamically assigning a list of 
skills to a character object based on its job and level. 


I would like to continue working on this project. I will likely create a private development repository as I workshop features. 
Not only is it useful for growing as a developer, but it also has the potential to be a tool I will actually use again in the future. 
I believe that by the time I’m done, I will have a genuinely interesting portfolio piece that I can talk about excitedly in the future.
